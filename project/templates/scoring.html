    <p>Each player starts with the opportunity to get 1000 points per question</p>
    <p>The player that gets the question correct first gets 1000 points</p>
    <p>The next player to get the question correct gets 1000/2 so 500 points</p>
    <p>This continues as more players answer the question correctly</p>
